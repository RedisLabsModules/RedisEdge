summary: The Edge Computing Data Service for the IoT Edge
description: |
  RedisEdge from Redis Labs is a purpose-built, multi-model database for the demanding conditions at
  the Internet of Things (IoT) edge. It can ingest writes at speed with <1ms latency and
  a very small footprint (<5MB), so it easily resides in constrained compute environments. It can run
  on a variety of edge devices and sensors ranging from ARM32 to x64-based hardware. RedisEdge bundles
  open source Redis (version 5 with Redis Streams) with the RedisAI and RedisTimeSeries modules, along
  with RedisGears for inter-module communication.

# TODO: add armhf here when that's supported
architectures:
  - build-on: amd64

# for start-timeout, we need snapd 2.38
# we need command-chain for the hooks too
assumes: [snapd2.38, command-chain]

# Ideally snapcraft would generate this command-chain spec for the hooks
# automatically, but that doesn't currently work, see
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1824255
# In the meantime, make sure that the snapcraft-runner gets generated by 
# the apps by specifying the full adapter in at least one of the apps, and 
# manually craft the command-chain for the configure hook here to passthrough
# to the snap.yaml
# All of this is necessary so we can use jq and other tools from inside the 
# snap in the configure and install hooks
